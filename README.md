# Pacman: *Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI Assignment*

## Bram Sch√∂nfeldt

This is my completed code for the Search assignment. The report is called `SearchReportBramSchonfeldt.pdf`.

After downloading all the required files from the [course website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa20/project1/) (those we were not supposed to alter that render pacman and his many mazes), the autograder can be run via `python autograder.py`.

Note that the default heuristic (*actual distance to furthest bite of food*) for question 7, takes a while to compute
for each step of the algorithm, however, results in a very low number of 'legal expansions'. For a faster
heuristic at the cost of more expansions, I have also defined the *manhattan distance to the furthest bite of food*. Using this
only requires uncommenting line 469 of searchAgents.

More details for the assignment can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa20/project1/)
